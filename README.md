# Lost?

CC_Lost is powered by [iHi.im](http://ihi.im), built by [Ben Howdle](http://benhowdle.im/) and [Jack Smith](http://jacksmith.is). iHi is on Github [here](https://github.com/benhowdle89/ihi).

**Lost** aims to direct folk who are looking to attend the local meet up [CroydonCreativ.es](http://croydoncreativ.es). It can be a bit hard to find the venue so this will guide visitors from their current location directly to the <strike>beer</strike> bar!
